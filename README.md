## Gerry's Grill
     <p>Originally opening in 1997 in Quezon City, Phillipines, Gerry's Grill has rapidly expanded outside of the Phillipines and into your local area! Gerry's Grill is a popular restaurant for all your filipino favorites. If you want to have a formal sit-down dinner, Gerry's Grill is a popular local spot where many filipinos enjoy eating at. Some popular dishes include crispy pata (my all-time favorite filipino dish), lechon kawali, chicken pork adobo, beef kaldareta, sizzling sisig, and many more cultural cravings. Need something to wrap up your meal? You NEED to try their halo-halo! Buko pandan and leche flan are also some other fan favorites.</p>

    <p>Located in Cerritos, this hot spot has delicious filipino platters. Looking for a snack? They have those too.

## Bakers and Baristas
    <p>Bakers and Baristas is not your traditional filipino brunch spot, fusing filipino cuisine with their many dishes. Nonetheless, Bakers and Baristas is the perfect hang-out spot for any meal. Opened by two brothers in 2015, this restaurant specializes in breakfast, lunch, or brunch! My personal favorite dish is their roasted pork belly bowl, which includes garlic rice, fried egg, cabbage slaw, and pork belly! If you're looking into a more traditional filipino breakfast, their tapsilog is to die for. Marinated sirloin (tapa), white garlic rice, fried egg, with a side of banana ketchup. Bakers and Baristas also have a selection of burritos, pancakes, and toast! Be sure to try their unique collection of coffees and teas. They have different flavors such as sparkling matcha yuzu, chrysanthemum, matcha, vanilla bean, honey lavender, honey oat, salted caramel, and multiple other options. Bakers and Baristas should be on your list for your next brunch spot!</p>

## Noy Pitz
    <p>Noy Pitz is my all-time favorite filipino restaurant in Cerritos. Opened by Larry Calonzo and Michael Kwan in April 2018 in West Covina, their restaurant has expanded to different parts of the U.S. Some best-sellers include their sizzling pork sisig and their crispy pata. If you aren't a pork lover, they also have beef, chicken, and seafood. Vegetarian? Noypitz also offers traditional filipino vegetable dishes, such as pinakbet, ginataang sitaw at kalabasa, and adobong sitaw. They also have different soups, rice, noodles, and house specials. On top of that, their wide-range of desserts stands out in comparison to many filipino restaurants I have visited. Their halo-halo is a huge cup with ice, condensed milk, ube ice cream, and assorted toppings such as fruits, jelly, and beans. At night, a band plays for entertainment while you eat your food. There's also a bar if you want to get a drink or two after your meal! </p>
